# LLM Agent Function Calling

This repository is the foundation for our project aimed at developing an advanced LLM agent that can intelligently determine when to invoke external functions. Our vision is to integrate natural language understanding with actionable tool execution, allowing the agent to perform dynamic and context-aware operations. 

## Our philosophy
Invoke external tools only when the context demands, ensuring that each function call is deliberate and impactful.

## Our Vision

- **Intelligent Function Invocation:** Enable the LLM to decide, in context, when and how to call external functions to achieve a goal.
- **Modular & Evolving Architecture:** We plan to develop a modular system where components such as data processing, training, and function integration can independently evolve and improve over time.
- **Continuous Experimentation:** We believe in iterative development, leveraging community insights to refine the fine-tuning process and enhance function calling accuracy.

## Current Status

This repository is in its early stages, laying the groundwork for future development. Upcoming updates will include:
- A fine-tuning pipeline and training scripts.
- Example datasets with annotated function calls.
- Evaluation tools and interactive demos.

## Getting Started

The repository is currently empty. In upcoming releases, you will find detailed setup instructions, training scripts, and documentation on how to contribute.
